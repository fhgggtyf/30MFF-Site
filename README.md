# 30MFF-Site

Project Description:
The project is to create a website advertising an imaginary archipelago and aims to attract tourists to go there. Therefore the main theme is nature, and I want the viewer to feel a taste of the pleasure of going to the archipelago when viewing the page.

Process:
To achieve what was said in the description, I decided to use photos of the archipelago on the first section of the page, which is the place where the viewer first sees when opening the page. On this page I put the website motto and a sign-up button so that people that are akready determined to come this place can sign-up convieniently. Then, for the people who are still considering and will scroll down, There will be aspects they can experience on there trip there. After that, there will be a short video on the scenery there (which is the 1-min film). At last, when they have read all the things they could do there and watched the film, there will be a signup button again, so that the viewer won't have to go all the way up to sign up.

Reflections:
The initial concept was to make the pages fade in as the page is moved to that sector. However, the javascript was harder than expected. I tried combining related tutorials but it still wouldn't work. I guess it might be my code was too messy and some bug happened. But otherwise, all goals have been fulfilled.
