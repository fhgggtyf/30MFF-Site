# 30MFF-Site

Project Description:
The project is to create a website advertising an imaginary archipelago and aims to attract tourists to go there. Therefore, the main theme is nature, and I want the viewer to feel a taste of the pleasure of going to the archipelago when viewing the page.

Process:
To achieve what was said in the description, I decided to use photos of the archipelago on the first section of the page, which is the place where the viewer first sees when opening the page. On this page, I put the website motto and a sign-up button so that people who are already determined to come to this place can sign up conveniently. Then, for the people who are still considering and will scroll down, There will be aspects they can experience on their trip there. After that, there will be a short video on the scenery (a 1-min film). At last, when they have read all the things they could do there and watched the film, there will be a signup button again so that the viewer won't have to go all the way up to sign up. I used JavaScript to change the background image of the first page every 5 seconds. I also included a simple login page connected to the signup button. Also, the logo on the top left corner of the screen will bring the viewer back to the top of the page when clicked.

Reflections:
The initial concept was to make the pages fade in as the page is moved to that sector. However, the javascript was harder than expected. I tried combining related tutorials, but it still wouldn't work. I guess it might be my code was too messy, and some bug happened. But otherwise, all goals have been fulfilled.
